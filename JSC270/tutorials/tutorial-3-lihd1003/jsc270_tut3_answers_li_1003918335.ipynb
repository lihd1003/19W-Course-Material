    "- This tutorial comprises two parts. <font color='blue'>**In the first part, you will work with a tutorial partner. The second part is individual.**</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make a copy of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The notebook should be named: jsc270_tut3_answers_lastname_studentnumber, where \"lastname\" is your last name, and \"studentnumber\" is your UofT student number. <font color='blue'>**While you will work in pairs during the tutorial, both of your team members should commit the same notebook in their Github classroom repositority separately.**.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Answer the questions in the cells that indicate where your answers should be placed. Leave the initial comment in the code cell and heading (indicated by `# Answer for qustion XX`).  For example, place your answer for Question 1 in the markdown cell with comment `# Enter your answer for Question 1 into this cell` (remember not to delete this comment).\n",

    "### When should it be submitted?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **At the end of the tutorial (in-lab tutorial assignment)**: Commit and push your notebook to the Github classroom repository that contains your answers (i.e., the file named: jsc270_tut1_answers_lastname_studentnumber.ipynb) before 14:10 on the day of the tutorial, January 30. <font color='blue'>**Each group member should submit the group notebook separately.** Make sure you also commit and push all of the **csv file(s) with participants' answers to your survey**.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`nbdime`](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Python package that allows you (and the teaching team) to see the changes you have made to your assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Homework (tutorial assignment completion)**: Push your completed tutorial by 11:30, Monday, February 4.  Your last commit closest to 11:30 will be considered your final assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where should the assignment be submitted?\n",
