    "# Problem Setup\n",
    "For two rigid bodies $A, B$. A collision happens when two rigid bodies have contact, i.e. some point on $A$ has $0$ distance to some point on $B$. For the simulation, a collision is divided into two parts, detection and response. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Collision Detection\n",
    "We want to find whether two rigid bodies collide (whether $y_A, y_B$ contact) and often want to have the contact normals $\\hat n$. The detection for different types of objects are quite different. For simplicity, we only consider the collision between a moving rigid body $A$ and a static plane $P$. In this case, we can detect on each vertex of the rigid body and have the contact normal be defined as the outward facing normal $\\hat n_P$ as contact normal. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Collision Response\n",
    "Note that a rigid body is moved by the rigid transformation $R, p$, so that we cannot update/response based on vertices. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Signorini Conditions (3 Rules of of Contact Mechanics)\n",
    "Given the two points $y_A, y_B$ be the contact point on $A, B$. Consider the contact mechanics, we want our collision resolution to satisfy\n",
    " 1. No inter-penetration between two objects: $d(y_A, y_B) \\geq 0$ where $d$ is the signed distance. \n",
    " 2. Contact forces \"push\" objects apart: $f_{contact} = a\\hat n, a\\in\\mathbb R^{\\geq 0}$\n",
    " 3. Contact forces can only be applied when objects are in contact, or __complementarity__ $d(y_A, y_B)\\perp a$"
