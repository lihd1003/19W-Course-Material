    "# Problem Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a surface embedded or immersed in $\\mathbb R^3$, we want to find its flatten map in $\\mathbb R^2$. With this process, the 2D flattened mesh can be interpreted as a parameterization of the 3D surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, given a list of vertices $V\\in\\mathbb R^{n\\times 3}$, we can to find some $U\\in \\mathbb R^{n\\times 2}$, i.t. assign the $uv$ coordinates from $xyz$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in general, because we reduce the dimension. Some parts of the surface will have to be stretched and some will be squished. Surfaces with topological handles or without a boundary must be cut. "

    "# Mass Spring Methods\n",

    "Consider the connection between parameterization and graph drawing in infoviz. If we treat our mesh a vertices and edges, i.e. a graph, then the problem can be viewed as graph drawing. Then, we can optimize over node locations with the energy\n",

    "\n",
    "Of course, the trivial solution will have every vertex map to $(0, 0)$, so we need to add some fixed point constraints, However, if we just choose fixed points arbitrarily, then in general we will have __fold over__, i.t. edges cross each other, overlapping of mesh triangles, and inverted normal direction. \n",

    "## Weighted Potential Energy\n",
    "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutte_embedding\">By Tutte's Embedding</a>, we do have a way to avoid fold over. If the boundary of a disk-topology mesh is fixed to a convex polygon, then minimizing the energy above will give injective flattening. However, this method tends to have all edges with equal length. Combined with the boundary constraints, the flattened mesh will have a grid-like shape (smoothly varying edge lengths, near equilateral triangles) regardless the triangle shapes and sizes on the surface mesh. To improve, we introduce a varying spring stiffness $w_{ij}$ for each edge, i.e. \n",

    "For example, let $w_{ij} = \\|v_i - v_j\\|^{-1}$ so that shorter edges on the 3D mesh gets more energy. This will help the length distortion problem, while we still have the area distortion and angle distortion problem. \n",

    "Note that $L$ is the discrete Laplacians, if $w_{ij}=1$, then $L$ is the uniform Laplacian, if $w_{ij}$ is based on edge lengths, then $L$ corresponds to a physical static equilibrium problem for a linear spring system. \n",
