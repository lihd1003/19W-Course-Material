    "# Problem Setup\n",

    "## Voxel-based Implicit Surface\n",
    "However, if we directly convert the point cloud to a mesh by connecting points together, it's difficult to ensure the certain topological postconditions, i.e. a closed manifold with a small number of holes. Instead we will first convert the point cloud sampling representation into an implicit surface representation. Let the unknown surface be the level set of some function $g:\\mathbb R^3\\rightarrow\\mathbb R$, i.e. \n",
    "$$\\partial S = \\{x\\in\\mathbb R^3\\mid g(x) = c\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we discretize an implicit function by defining a regular 3D grid of voxels containing at least the bounding box of $S$. At each node in the grid $x_{i,j,k}$ we store the value of the implicit function $g(x_{i,j,k}) and then we can get the value everywhere by trilinear interpolation over the grid cell. \n",
