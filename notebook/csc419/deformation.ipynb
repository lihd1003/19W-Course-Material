    "# Problem Setup\n",
    "The user repositions a sparse set of points  and the goal is to propagate the transformations at these \"handles\" to the rest of the shape. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the point rest position $\\tilde x \\in \\mathbb R^3$, we will write its unknown deformed position as $x$ and the point's displacement vector $d := x - \\tilde x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem can be thought of two ways \n",
    " - as a scattered data interpolation, where the handles are the sparse samples and we want to interpolate over the unknown displacement field\n",
    " - as a shape optimization problem, where we try to define a new shape that retains the details of the old shape but fulfill the handle constraints. \n",

    "## Properties to Consider In Deformation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuity\n",
    "The deformation should be continuous, i.e. the shape will not tear, crack or change topological features. i.e. the face matrix $F = \\tilde F$ will not change, only $V$ should be determined from $\\tilde V$. \n",

    "### Generic Distortion Minimization\n",
    "A rest surface $\\tilde S$ immersed in $\\mathbb R^3$ can be described as a mapping $\\tilde x$ from some 2D parametric domain $\\Omega$. i.e. $\\tilde x: \\Omega \\subseteq \\mathbb R^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb R^3$, similarly define the deformed surface as $x:\\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb R^3$ and displacement vector field as $d(u, v) = x(u, v) - \\tilde x(u, v)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider distortion minimization and the handle's position as energy minimization with constraints. Suppose we have some energy functional $E(x)$ that measures the amount of distortion. A natural choice of distortion measurement is by intergrating local distortion over all points, i.e. we have the problem\n",

    "# Gradient based Energy\n",
    "If we assume that the deformation is small then we can measure the distortion as the magnitude of gradient of the displacement field, i.e. if the displacement field has large variations or sudden changes then it induces a lot of distortion. \n",

    "$$\\int_\\Omega \\|e(x)\\|^2 dA = \\int_\\Omega \\|\\mathbf Dd\\|_F^2 dA $$\n",

    "\n",
    "However this methods is not smooth at constraints and the influence of handles dies off too quickly. By minimizing the Dirichlet energy, each coordinate of \"displacement field\" is a harmonic function. Intuitively (however abstractly) we can think of each function as diffusing the user's constraints as if they were heat values. As such, each function diffuses quickly to an average, slowly varying value over most of the domain. As a displacement field a constant value for each coordinate function would mean a translation: most of the shape is simply translated.\n",

    "If we think of the gradient of the position function  (with respect to the underlying parameterization) as a local geometric feature descriptor then this energy can be re-understood as measuring the difference in this feature before and after the deformation. This is very sensible as we are trying to measure distortion. We would expect that a low-distortion deformation would correspond with a small change to local features.\n"

The Laplacian of the position function $\\Delta x$ as a feature descriptor is not rotation invariant. This problem is also true for all linear differential features.
