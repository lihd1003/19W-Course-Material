<h1>Define Curvature</h1>
<p>For a planar curve $\gamma:[0, 1]\rightarrow \mathbb R^2$, consider the following definitions</p>
<h2>Osculating circle</h2>
<p>Define the <strong>tangent direction</strong> at a point $p=\gamma(s)$ as the secant line formed by approaching $p$ from $q$ on the curve, i,e,
$$\mathbf t (s) = \lim_{\mathbf q\rightarrow \mathbf p}\frac{\mathbf q-\mathbf p}{\|\mathbf q-\mathbf p\|} = \lim_{t\rightarrow s}\frac{\gamma(t)-\gamma(s)}{\|\gamma(t)-\gamma(s)\|} = \frac{\gamma'(s)}{\|\gamma'(s)\|}$$
Assume without loss of generality that $s$ is an arc length parameterization, so that $\|\gamma'\| = 1$, then the unit tangent is simply $\gamma'(s)$.</p>
<p>We can also consider the limit of the circum-circle $C(\mathbf q_1, \mathbf p, \mathbf q_2)$ (Note that a circum-circle is the circle passing through all the points, and 3 points can uniquely defines a circle), where $\mathbf q_1 = \gamma(t_1), \mathbf q_2=\gamma(t_2), t_1 &lt; s &lt; t_2$, so that we can define the limit circum-circle as 
$$C(\mathbf p) = \lim_{\mathbf q_1\rightarrow \mathbf p-, \mathbf q_2\rightarrow \mathbf p+} C(\mathbf q_1, \mathbf p, \mathbf q_2)$$
We call $C(\mathbf p)$ the <strong>ocsulating circle</strong> at the point $\mathbf p$ on $\gamma$, the tangent of the curve and the circle match as $\gamma'(s)$ and the radius $R(\mathbf p)$ of $C(\mathbf p)$ is proportional to how straight the curve is locally. $R\rightarrow \infty$ when the curve is getting to be a line. Therefore, the radius is inversely proportional the the curvyness. Hence, define the curvature as 
$$\kappa(\mathbf p) = R(\mathbf p)^{-1}$$</p>
<p>Thinking about how we construct the circum-circle from the three points, we can have 
$$R(\mathbf p) = \lim_{q_1,q_2\rightarrow p} \frac{\|\mathbf q_1-\mathbf p\|\|\mathbf p-\mathbf q_2\|\|\mathbf q_2-\mathbf q_1\|}{2|(\mathbf q_1-\mathbf p)\times (\mathbf p-\mathbf q_2)|}$$</p>

<h2>Signed Curvature</h2>
<p>Another way of thinking about curvature is by plugging in the arc-length parameterization, where the curvature is equal to the magnitude of change in the tangent, 
$$\kappa(s) = \lim_{t\rightarrow s}\|\frac{\gamma'(t) - \gamma'(s)}{t-s}\| = \|\gamma''(s)\|$$
Since we are having arc-length parameterization, the only change to the tangent $\gamma'$ is the change in direction. This means that the change is orthogonal to the tangent, i.e.
$$\gamma''\cdot \gamma' = 0\Rightarrow y''\cdot\hat{\mathbf n} = \pm \kappa \hat{\mathbf n}$$
If we define an orientation of our curve (we have starting point and ending point as from $\gamma(0)$ to $\gamma(1)$), then we can endow the curvature with a sign based on whether $C(\mathbf p)$ lies on the left of right side of the curve. And since the orthogonal relationship, the vector from $\mathbf p$ to the circle's center $c(\mathbf p)$ must be perpendicular to the tangent, i.e. the positive or negative normal directions.</p>
<p>If the orientation agrees with increasing the arc-length parameter $s$, then the sign can be determined by comparing the second derivative $\gamma''$ to the unit normal $\hat{\mathbf n} = \gamma'^{\perp}$. The <strong>signed curvature</strong> at $\mathbf p$ is 
$$k(\mathbf p) = \text{sign} (\gamma''(\mathbf p)\cdot\hat{\mathbf n})\cdot \kappa(\mathbf p) = \gamma''(\mathbf p)\cdot \hat{\mathbf n}$$</p>

<h2>Moving point analogy</h2>
<p>Thinking about the curve as the trajectory formed by a moving particle, parameterized by time $t$, hence $\gamma'(t)$ is the velocity and $\|\gamma'(t)\|$ the speed. Reparameterize the trajectory with a perfectly uniform speed $\|\gamma'(s(t))\| = 1$.</p>
<p>Then, the curvature is the amount of "turning". Imagine this is driven by a steering wheel, then straight line is no turning, the circle is turning the wheel to a particular fixed angle (left = positive, right = negative) and changing the steering wheel is equal to changing the curvature.</p>

<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<h2>Turning number</h2>
<p>The integrated signed curvature around a closed curve must be an <strong>integer</strong> multiple of $2\pi$, i.e. 
$$\oint_S k(s)ds = 2\pi\tau$$
$\tau$ is called the turning number of the curve.</p>
<p>Note that we can accumulating the "turning", since we are on a closed curve, thinking about the moving point analogy, the point will eventually turning back for any starting point. Therefore, the accumulated direction can turn an integer times of a circle.</p>

<h2>Discrete Curvature</h2>
<p>To discretize a curve, we need to fit it to a piecewise linear chain of segments. And for each point on the chain, define the discrete curvature as the change in tangent direction</p>
<p><img src="./assets/discrete-curvature.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>The turning number still holds in this case, since we will "turning back" eventually, i.e. 
$$\sum k_i = 2\pi\tau$$</p>

<h1>Surface Curvature</h1>
<p>For a surface $\mathcal S$, note that along different directions, we have different curves (for example, thinking about a potato chip). Therefore, it's more difficult to understand the curvature of a surface.</p>
<p>More specifically, we want to find some path/direction/trajectory on the surface, so that we can have a curve, and extend the definition curvature on that curve.</p>
<h2>Normal curvature</h2>
<p>The simplest way to extend curvature on the point $\mathbf p\in \mathcal S$ is to "cut" through the surface with a plane $P$ along the normal $\mathbf n(\mathbf p)$.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/normal-curvature.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>so that we get some curve from the intersection of $P$ and $\mathcal S$. Note that there are infinitely many planes passing $\mathbf p$ and lie parallel to $\mathbf n(\mathbf q)$, as we rotating $P$ around $\mathbf n$ with any angle $\varphi$. Therefore, we can parameterize and define normal curvature for each choice of $\varphi$ as
$$k_{\mathbf n}(\varphi, \mathbf p) = \gamma_\varphi''(\mathbf p)$$</p>
<h2>Mean curvature</h2>
<p>Normal curvature defines infinitely many curvature values, which is undesirable. One way to reduce the space of normal curvature is the take the mean of all normal curvatures. 
$$H(\mathbf p) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} k_{\mathbf n}(\varphi,\mathbf p)d\varphi$$</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"><div class="inner_cell">
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<h2>Max/Min curvature</h2>
<p>Another obvious way of reduction is 
$$k_1(\mathbf p) = \max_{\varphi} k_{\mathbf n}(\varphi, \mathbf p), \quad k_2(\mathbf p) = \min_{\varphi} k_{\mathbf n}(\varphi, \mathbf p)$$
$k_1,k_2$ are referred as the <strong>principal curvatures</strong>. with corresponding angles
$$\varphi_1(\mathbf p) = \arg\max_\varphi k_{\mathbf n}(\varphi, \mathbf p), \quad \varphi_2(\mathbf p) = \arg\min_\varphi k_{\mathbf n}(\varphi, \mathbf p)$$
By Euler's theorem
$$k_{\mathbf n}(\varphi, \mathbf p) = k_1\cos^2\varphi + k_2\sin^2\varphi$$
And the corollary</p>
<ol>
<li>$\varphi_1\perp \varphi_2$</li>
<li>$H = \frac12(k_1 + k_2)$</li>

<h2>Gaussian curvature</h2>
<p>Max/min/mean curvature cannot alone distinguish between points lying on a round ball, a flat sheet of paper, and the potato chip. So we introduce Gaussian curvature, 
$$K = k_1k_2$$
$K$ maintains the disagreement in sign that categories the saddle-like behavior (positive in one direction and negative in another)</p>

<h1>Relationship to Surface Area</h1>
<h2>Mean curvature as area gradient</h2>
<p>Consider the problem of finding a flow of a given surface $\mathcal S$ in the direction that shrinks the surface area. We write the surface area as the integral of unit density 
$$A(\mathcal S) = \int_S 1d\mathbf x = \int_S \|\nabla \mathbf x\|^2 d\mathbf x, \|\nabla \mathbf x\| = 1$$
there are many expressions for $1$ in the integral, but we pick the differential norm (the change in position over a small change in position), and to make sure linearity, we use the squared norm, hence the area is a quadratic function os positions and familiarly as the Dirichlet energy.</p>
<p>Note that $A(S, \mathbf x)$ is a functional with varying $\mathbf x$. So that the functional derivative, for any $\mathbf y$</p>
\begin{align*}
\frac{dA}{d\mathbf x} &amp;= \lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0}\frac{A(\mathbf x + \epsilon \mathbf y) - A(\mathbf x)}{\epsilon}\\
&amp;= \left [\frac{d}{d\epsilon}A(\mathbf x + \epsilon\mathbf y)\right]_{\epsilon=0}\\
&amp;= \left [\frac{d}{d\epsilon} \int_S\|\nabla\mathbf x + \epsilon\nabla \mathbf y\|^2 d\mathbf x \right]_{\epsilon=0}\\
&amp;= \int_S 2\nabla \mathbf y\cdot \nabla \mathbf x d\mathbf x\\
&amp;= -\int_S \mathbf y \Delta \mathbf x d\mathbf x &amp;\text{assume closed surface, by Green's identity}
\end{align*}
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"><div class="inner_cell">
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>Then consider the derivative evaluated at some point $\mathbf u = (u, v)$. Since we can freely pick $\mathbf y$, let $y(a) = \mathbb I(a=\mathbf u)$, i.e. a "bump" at $\mathbf u$ and $0$ elsewhere so that 
$$\frac{dA}{d\mathbf x}(\mathbf u) = -2\Delta \mathbf x(\mathbf u)$$
where $\Delta$ is the Laplacian operator
$$\Delta f = \nabla\cdot\nabla f = \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial u^2} + \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial v^2}$$
In this case, we can pick the directions $\varphi_1, \varphi_2$ as our $u,v$, since the principal directions are orthogonal, so that 
$$\Delta\mathbf x = \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf x}{\partial\varphi_1^2}+\frac{\partial^2 \mathbf x}{\partial\varphi_2^2} = k_1\mathbf n + k_2\mathbf n = 2H\mathbf n$$</p>

<h2>Gaussian curvature as area distortion</h2>
<p>Consider Gaussian curvature $K=k_1k_2$, which is the product of principal curvatures. Note that $K=0$ IFF at least one of the principal curvature is $0$. In this case, the surface is called <strong>developable surfaces</strong> because it can be flattened (developed) onto a flat plane (Since the principal direction is 0, it's like a rolled paper, we can then unroll through the non-zero principal direction) without stretch of shearing. Locally, Gaussian curvature measures how far from developable the surface is: how much would the local area need to stretch to become flat.</p>
<p>Then, introducing the <strong>Gauss map</strong> $N:\mathcal S\rightarrow \mathcal S^2$ where 
$$N(\mathbf p) = \mathbf n(\mathbf p)$$
Then, consider a small patch on a curved surface. Gaussian curvature $K$ can equivalently be defined as the limit of hte ratio between the area swept out by the unit normal on the Gauss map $A_G$ and the area of the surface patch $A$, 
$$K = \lim_{A\rightarrow 0}\frac{A_G}{A}$$</p>

<p>Similar to the turning number theorem for curves, the <strong>theorem for surfaces</strong> states that 
$$\int_S K dA = 2\pi\chi(\mathcal S)$$
where $\chi(\mathcal S)$ is the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic">Euler characteristic</a></strong>  of the surface $\mathcal S$.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem for surfaces</strong> means that we cannot add Gaussian curvature to a surface without removing an equal amount some place else or changing the topology of the surface.</p>

<h2>Shape operator</h2>
<p>Let $\mathbf n$ be the unit normal for a point $\mathbf p$ on $\mathcal S$, let $\mathbf v$ s.t. $\mathbf v\cdot\mathbf n = 0$ (the unit tangent). Then we can ask how does the normal change as we move in the direction in $\mathbf v$ along the surface. 
$$S_\mathbf p(\mathbf v) = \nabla \mathbf n\cdot\mathbf v$$
$S_\mathbf p$ is the <strong>shape operator</strong> at point $\mathbf p$.</p>
<p>Note that any tangent vector can be spanned by 2 orthogonal basis tangent vectors, denote them as $\mathbf e_1,\mathbf e_2\in\mathbb R^2$. The shape operator as a differential operator is linear, for $\mathbf v = x_1\mathbf e_1 + x_2\mathbf e_2$, we have
$$S_\mathbf p(\mathbf v) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
S_{\mathbf p}(\mathbf e_1)\cdot \mathbf e_1&amp;S_{\mathbf p}(\mathbf e_1)\cdot \mathbf e_2\\
S_{\mathbf p}(\mathbf e_2)\cdot \mathbf e_1&amp;S_{\mathbf p}(\mathbf e_2)\cdot \mathbf e_2
\end{bmatrix}v$$
Given $\varphi_1, \varphi_2$ as the principal directions, we can rotate our coordinate frame to align $\mathbf e_1, \mathbf e_2$ with the principal directions, so that 
$$S_\mathbf p = \begin{bmatrix}\varphi_1&amp;\varphi_2\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}k_1&amp;0\\0&amp;k_2\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}\varphi_1&amp;\varphi_2\end{bmatrix}^T$$
Note that this is the Eigen decomposition of the shape operator. Therefore, Eigen decomposition will give principal directions as eigenvectors and principal curvatures as eigenvalues.</p>

<h1>Discretization</h1>
<p>First, review that the discrete Laplacian for triangle meshes is 
$$\Delta f \approx M^{-1}L\mathbf f$$
where $M$ is the mass matrix and $L$ is the cotangent matrix and $\mathbf f$ is the discrete approximation of $f$ .</p>
<p>If we apply this operator to vertex positions, we will have a pointwise approximation of the mean curvature normal
$$H\mathbf n \approx \mathbf H = M^{-1}LV\in\mathbb R^{n\times 3}$$</p>

<h2>Discrete Gaussian curvature via angle defect</h2>
<p>On a discrete surface, curvature cannot live on flat faces and edges (we can always develop/unroll the surface along the edge). Therefore, the curvature must live at vertices.</p>
<p>Using the definition in terms of the area on the Gauss map. Vertices correspond to spherical polygons connecting face normal points. The area $\Omega$ subtended on the Gauss map is called the <strong>solid angle</strong>. Conveniently, this area is simply the angle defect of internal angles $\theta_f$ incident on the $i$th vertex contributed by each $f$th incident faces. 
$$\Omega_i = 2\pi - \sum_{f\in faces(i)}\theta_{if}$$</p>

</div>
<div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"><div class="inner_cell">
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>Thus, our discrete analog of locally integrated Gaussian curvature is given as the angle defect at the $i$th vertex. The local integral average discrete Gaussian curvature is the angle defect divided by the local area associated with the $i$th vertex. 
$$K_i = \frac{\Omega_i}{A_i}$$</p>
<p>By ways of closing up the Gauss map, closed polyhedral surfaces will have 
$$\sum^n K_i = 2\pi \chi(S) = |V|-|E|+|F|$$
which connects with the Euler's formula.</p>

<h2>Approximation and Eigen decomposition of the shape operator</h2>
<p>Alternatively, we nned to approximate all curvatures of a surface by locally fitting an analytic surface so that we have its curvatures. The simplest is the quadratic surface.</p>
<p>The algorithm proceeds as follows</p>
<p>for $\mathbf v$ in $V$</p>
<ol>
<li>gather sampling points from neighborhood. For simplicity, find vertices in the <strong>two rings</strong> of $\mathbf v$, i.e. 
$$Ring_1 = \{\mathbf u\mid \mathbf u\mathbf v \in E\}, Ring_2 = \{\mathbf w\mid \exists \mathbf u. \mathbf u \mathbf v\in E\land \mathbf w \mathbf u\in E\}, Neighbor=Ring_1\cup Ring_2$$
Then, let $Neighbor \in\mathbb R^{k\times 3}$ be stacked vertices, construct $P = Neighbor - \mathbf v$ so that $P$ be the position of neighboring vertices relative to $\mathbf v$. </li>
<li>Compute PCA of $P$ (eigen decomposition of $P^TP$). Let $S\in \mathbb R^{k\times 2}$ be the principal directions ($u,v$ directions) and $B\in\mathbb R^k$ be the height of each point in the least principal direction $w$-direction.</li>
<li>An quadratic function as a height field surface passing through the origin is given by 
$$w = a_1u+a_2v + a_3u^2 + a_4uv +a_5v^2$$
We have $k$ sets of equations, and we can fits for the 5 parameters $a_i$. </li>
<li>The shape operator can be constructed as the product of the second and first fundamental form matrices
$$S = -\begin{bmatrix}e&amp;f\\f&amp;g\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}E&amp;F\\F&amp;g\end{bmatrix}^{-1}$$
The entries categorize the strech and bending in each direction</li>
