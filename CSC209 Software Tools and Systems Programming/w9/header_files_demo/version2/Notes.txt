Introduce the header file

play around with getting different error messages depending on 
including .c file.

Moving towards the idea that the global variable doesn't belong in the 
header file.

First compile with 
gcc -Wall -g -std=gnu99 -o main main.c

then 
gcc -Wall -g -std=gnu99 -o main main.c stack.c
