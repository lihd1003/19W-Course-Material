This demo is to illustrate header files and how things can go wrong.
ll.c implements a few linked list operations.
main.c calls functions in ll.c
stack.c uses the ll.c functions to implement push and pop.

Version 1: main.c includes ll.c
If you compile it as 
gcc -Wall -g -std=gnu99 -o main main.c
it will compile and run without errors.

Version 2: This adds the stack.c file.  The question is how to compile it?
gcc -Wall -g -std=gnu99 -o main main.c
leads to errors about push and pop
gcc -Wall -g -std=gnu99 -o main main.c stack.c
leads to errors about multiply defined symbols

Maybe include stack.c?  

Let's get it right.  Include ll.h in all the files and compile as
gcc -Wall -g -std=gnu99 -o main main.c stack.c ll.c  
Or use the Makefile


Version 3: Putting the global variable in the header file also doesn't work.  The error is about head being multiply defined.  So move the variable into main.c, and use 
extern in the header file, so the other files know it exists.

Version 4: Global variables are also bad because then we can have only one list.
Perhaps you want them for a singleton design pattern, but here (where we are essentially creating a linked-list API) we can imagine lots of situations where the user would want multiple independent lists or stacks.

Now, the question is whether to always pass in a pointer to pointer so the list is changed in the arguments, or to return the new list when possible. This is
a matter of style. We see that the second alternative is not always an option since some functions have used their return values for other purposes.
