For this last version of the demo, we change the design so that more
than one linked list or stack can be created. To do this we make the head
a local variable and now we can have more than one head. This means that
we have to pass the head to every function.

For the functions that can not possibly change the head, this is all we 
need to change.

But for some functions that can change the head, we must convey the information about the new head back to the caller. We can do this in two possible ways:
	1. return the new head  or
      2. pass a pointer to the head 

insert_head uses the first approach and delete_head uses the second. Note that delete_head could NOT use the first approach because the return value was already being used to return the value of the item that was deleted.
