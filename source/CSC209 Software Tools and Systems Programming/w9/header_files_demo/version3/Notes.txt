Get the global variable out of the header file.

Now it compiles and works fine. The thing left to discuss is the design.
How is the code constrained by the use of a single global variable for the
head of the list and/or stack? 

Is this constraint a feature or a bug? Depends on the situation in which
you want to use the linked list. Likely for a generic API like this, it is
a bug.
